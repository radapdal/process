# Web Development Workflow

Work smarter, not harder.



## Goals

The goal of this workflow is to increase productivity by letting the Agile nature of software requirements take it's course and handle it efficiently and effectively.

This workflow aims to:

- remove guesswork and constant back-and-forth by adding a Definition phase for every task so that management, developer, and QA are on the same page
- reduce QA issues and back-and-forth delay in communication by means of QA Demo
- promote discussion and eliminate miscommunication of requirements by having Daily Standup meetings and Backlog grooming
- improve on previous and future work by means of Retrospectives and Sprint Meetings
- provide a more accurate estimate on tasks via Points system

## 1. Sprint Meeting

Before the workflow starts the whole team gets to participate in the Sprint Meeting. In this meeting, the initial requirements for this iteration is introduced, clarified, defined, and estimated.

- ask questions regarding the tasks
- work with the team on how to define an issue
- provide an honest estimate

### 1.1 Backlog Grooming

Backlog grooming is the re-prioritization of tasks and description update, this is done by the Project Manager and communicated in the Sprint or Daily meeting.

### 1.2 Internal Definitions

Here the requirement's criteria of completion are defined.

**UX Criteria** - are requirements that affect a user experience but does not pertain to his/her behaviour.

Ex. Reduce font size, change menu color, delete section

**Acceptance Criteria** - are requirements that pertain to specific user behaviour and its results

Ex. Able to add item to cart from the product page, redirect to cart page

### 1.3 Point Estimates

Point estimates are used to represent task difficulty, not total number of hours. This is meant to provide a consensus on team members on how difficult they think the task is. After the point is finalized, the individual estimate by hour is added by the developer that intends to work on the issue.




## 2. Development

After the Sprint Meeting and the iteration is now ready for work, the sprint can now start on its intended start date.

### 2.1. Daily Meeting



### 2.2. DevQA Workflow
