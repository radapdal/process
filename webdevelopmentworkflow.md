# Web Development Workflow

Work smarter, not harder.



## Goals

The goal of this workflow is to increase productivity by letting the Agile nature of software requirements take it's course and handle it efficiently and effectively.

This workflow aims to:

- remove guesswork and constant back-and-forth by adding a Definition phase for every task so that management, developer, and QA are on the same page
- reduce QA issues and back-and-forth delay in communication by means of QA Demo
- promote discussion and eliminate miscommunication of requirements by having Daily Standup meetings and Backlog grooming
- improve on previous and future work by means of Retrospectives and Sprint Meetings
- provide a more accurate estimate on tasks via Points system
