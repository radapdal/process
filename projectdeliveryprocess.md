# Project Delivery Process

From conversation to definition to release.



## Goals

The goal of this process is to streamline the delivery of software via iterative scoping and deployment.

This process aims to:
- Get constant feedback and reduce error by deploying small but consistent iteration.
- Reduce risk of over-commitment and under-delivery by focusing the few tasks for the iteration.
- Increase team productivity by sense of accomplishment on every successful release.
