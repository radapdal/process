# Project Delivery Process

From conversation to definition to release.



## Goals

The goal of this process is to streamline the delivery of software via iterative scoping and deployment.

This process aims to:
- Get constant feedback and reduce error by deploying small but consistent iterations.
- Reduce risk of over-commitment and under-delivery by focusing key tasks required for the iteration.
- Increase client trust and team productivity by accomplishing multiple successful releases.
