# Project Delivery Process

From conversation to definition to release.



## Goals

The goal of this process is to streamline the delivery of software via iterative scoping and deployment.

This process is aiming to:
- get constant feedback and reduce error by deploying small but consistent iteration
- reduce risk of over-commitment and under-delivery by focusing the few tasks for the iteration
- increase team productivity by sense of accomplishment on every successful release
